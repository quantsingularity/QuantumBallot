# Comprehensive Test Suite for QuantumBallot Backend

## Overview

This test suite provides comprehensive testing for the QuantumBallot backend, covering all core modules, API routes, and security flows. The tests are designed to validate functionality, ensure data integrity, and catch potential issues before they reach production.

## Test Coverage

### Core Modules

- **Crypto Module**: Encryption/decryption, key generation, identifier creation
- **Blockchain Module**: Block creation, transaction processing, chain validation
- **Committee Module**: User management, authentication, voter registration
- **API Routes**: Blockchain and committee endpoints
- **Middleware**: JWT verification, credentials validation

### Test Types

- **Unit Tests**: Testing individual functions and components
- **Integration Tests**: Testing interactions between modules
- **API Tests**: Testing HTTP endpoints and responses
- **Security Tests**: Testing authentication and data protection

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode during development
npm run test:watch
```

## Test Structure

- `tests/crypto.test.js`: Tests for cryptographic operations
- `tests/blockchain.test.js`: Tests for blockchain functionality
- `tests/committee.test.js`: Tests for committee management
- `tests/api.test.js`: Tests for API routes
- `tests/middleware.test.js`: Tests for middleware components
- `tests/mocks/`: Mock implementations for testing

## Implementation Notes

The test suite uses Jest as the testing framework and includes mocks for external dependencies to ensure tests are isolated and repeatable. The tests are designed to be comprehensive, covering both positive and negative scenarios, edge cases, and security-sensitive operations.

## Future Improvements

- Add more edge case testing for blockchain operations
- Implement performance testing for high-load scenarios
- Add end-to-end tests for complete user flows
- Implement continuous integration to run tests automatically
