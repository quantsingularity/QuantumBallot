# Architecture Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the QuantumBallot system architecture, including component interactions, data flow, and technical design decisions.

## System Overview

QuantumBallot is a blockchain-based voting system designed with a microservices architecture that consists of three main components:

1. **Backend API**: Node.js/Express.js server that manages the blockchain, authentication, and business logic
2. **Web Frontend**: React application for election committee members
3. **Mobile Frontend**: React Native application for voters

## High-Level Architecture

### Component Interaction

The system follows a client-server architecture where:

1. The Backend API serves as the central component, managing the blockchain and business logic
2. The Web Frontend and Mobile Frontend act as clients, communicating with the Backend API via RESTful endpoints
3. Real-time updates are facilitated through Socket.IO connections
4. The blockchain provides an immutable ledger for vote transactions

## Backend Architecture

### Core Components

The Backend API is structured into the following core components:

1. **API Layer**: Express.js routes and controllers that handle HTTP requests
2. **Service Layer**: Business logic implementation
3. **Blockchain Core**: Custom blockchain implementation for vote storage and verification
4. **Data Access Layer**: Interfaces with LevelDB for blockchain persistence
5. **Authentication System**: JWT-based authentication and authorization
6. **Real-time Communication**: Socket.IO server for live updates

### Blockchain Implementation

The blockchain is implemented with the following characteristics:

- **Block Structure**:
  - Index
  - Timestamp
  - Transactions array (votes)
  - Previous block hash
  - Current block hash
  - Nonce (for proof of work)

- **Consensus Mechanism**: Proof of Work
  - Difficulty level adjusts based on network hash rate
  - Target block time: 30 seconds

- **Transaction Validation**:
  - Digital signatures using public-key cryptography
  - Prevention of double-voting
  - Verification of voter eligibility

### Data Flow

1. **Vote Casting Process**:
   - Voter authenticates via the Mobile Frontend
   - Vote is digitally signed with the voter's private key
   - Transaction is submitted to the Backend API
   - Backend validates the transaction and adds it to pending transactions
   - Mining process creates a new block containing the vote
   - Block is added to the blockchain
   - Real-time updates are sent to all connected clients

2. **Election Management Process**:
   - Committee members create and configure elections via the Web Frontend
   - Election data is stored in the blockchain as special transactions
   - Candidate information is linked to elections through transaction metadata
   - Results are calculated by analyzing the blockchain transactions

## Frontend Architectures

### Web Frontend

The Web Frontend follows a component-based architecture using React and TypeScript:

1. **State Management**:
   - React Query for server state
   - Context API for application state
   - Local component state for UI-specific state

2. **Component Structure**:
   - Atomic design pattern (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages)
   - Reusable UI components with Radix UI and Material UI
   - Container/Presenter pattern for complex components

3. **Routing**:
   - React Router for navigation
   - Protected routes for authenticated content
   - Role-based access control

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Recharts and MUI X-Charts for election statistics
   - Custom visualization components for blockchain explorer

### Mobile Frontend

The Mobile Frontend is built with React Native and Expo:

1. **Navigation**:
   - React Navigation for screen management
   - Tab-based navigation for main sections
   - Stack navigation for screen flows

2. **State Management**:
   - Context API for global state
   - React Query for server data
   - Secure storage for sensitive information

3. **UI Components**:
   - React Native Paper for consistent UI elements
   - Custom components for election-specific features
   - Responsive layouts for different device sizes

4. **Native Features**:
   - Camera access for ID verification and QR scanning
   - Secure storage for credentials
   - Push notifications for election updates

## Security Architecture

Security is a critical aspect of the QuantumBallot system and is implemented at multiple levels:

### Authentication and Authorization

1. **User Authentication**:
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Password hashing with bcrypt
   - Two-factor authentication option
   - Session management and token refresh

2. **Authorization**:
   - Role-based access control (Voter, Committee Member, Admin)
   - Permission-based API access
   - Middleware validation for all protected routes

### Data Security

1. **Encryption**:
   - TLS/SSL for all communications
   - Encryption of sensitive data at rest
   - Secure key storage

2. **Blockchain Security**:
   - Cryptographic hashing (SHA-256)
   - Digital signatures for all transactions
   - Proof of work consensus mechanism
   - Distributed ledger for transparency

3. **Application Security**:
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, injection)
   - Rate limiting and brute force protection
   - Audit logging of all security-relevant events

## Network Architecture

### Production Deployment

In a production environment, the system is deployed with the following network architecture:

1. **Load Balancing**:
   - Multiple backend instances behind a load balancer
   - Geographic distribution for resilience and performance

2. **Blockchain Network**:
   - Distributed nodes for blockchain consensus
   - Peer-to-peer communication between nodes
   - Automatic node discovery and synchronization

3. **Database Clustering**:
   - Replicated LevelDB instances for blockchain storage
   - Backup and recovery mechanisms

4. **Content Delivery**:
   - CDN for static assets
   - Edge caching for improved performance
