Chainocracy
=================
A full-stack Web and Mobile application for the American election using Blockchain Technology behind the scenes. The system presents a user-friendly interface accessible via both mobile and web platforms.

Committee members can seamlessly access the application through their browser, while voters have the convenience of utilizing their smartphones, whether running on iOS or Android.

In summary, the system enables users to authenticate themselves within the application, manage the content, send data, scan QR codes, observe live projections, analyze charts, and gain insights into blockchain representations through graphical means, among other functionalities. It is worth noting that, depending on the viewer's perspective, the interface may appear somewhat complex, particularly regarding the graphical illustration of blockchain operations.
