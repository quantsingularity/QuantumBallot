# QuantumBallot - Blockchain-Based Voting System

## Project Overview

QuantumBallot is a comprehensive blockchain-based voting system designed to provide secure, transparent, and verifiable elections. The system leverages blockchain technology to ensure the integrity and immutability of votes, while providing a user-friendly experience for both election administrators and voters.

The project consists of three main components:

1. **Backend API**: A Node.js/Express.js server that manages the blockchain, handles authentication, processes votes, and provides real-time updates.
2. **Web Frontend**: A React-based web application for election committee members to manage elections, monitor voting progress, and verify voter identities.
3. **Mobile Frontend**: A React Native application for voters to authenticate, view candidate information, cast votes, and verify their vote submission.
